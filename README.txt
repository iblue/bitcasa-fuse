What is this?

This, ladies and gentlemen, is the bitcase linux client. I wanted to
have one, so I wrote one. Took me $n minutes. 

Heav phun.

Installation
============

* Install the fuse development headers (fuse-devel on fedora,
may vary on other distributions)
* Install RVM
* Install Ruby 2.0
* Run bundle install in this directory
* Wait for iblue to implement the codez
